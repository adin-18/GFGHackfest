            {% if health_condition == 'Diabetes' %}
                Diabetes is a condition characterized by high blood sugar levels due to the body's inability to produce or properly use insulin. Managing diabetes involves controlling carbohydrate intake, maintaining a balanced diet, and monitoring blood sugar levels.
            {% elif health_condition == 'Hypertension' %}
                Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other health problems. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-sodium foods is recommended to manage hypertension.
            {% elif health_condition == 'Obesity' %}
                Obesity occurs when excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may harm health. A balanced, nutrient-dense diet low in calories and fats is important for managing obesity and promoting weight loss.
            {% elif health_condition == 'Anemia' %}
                Anemia is a condition where the body lacks enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to the tissues. Eating iron-rich foods and foods high in vitamin C to aid iron absorption is key to managing anemia.
